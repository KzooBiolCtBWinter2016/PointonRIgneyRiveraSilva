Arduino climate control
--------

### Arduino script

The script measures and controls temperature and humidity.  
The first if statement maintains humidity between 60% and 70%.
The second if statement maintains the temperature at a constant level between 30 and 31 degrees Celsius (equivalent of 86 and 88 degrees Fahrenheit).
The script also reports failure in the reading from the sensor and exits the process.

More information can be found commented along the code contained in the group_project.ino file.

### Project set up

Basic requirements:  
*One Arduino with a breadboard.  
*One temperature and humidity sensor.  
*Two relays.  
*One humidifier.  
*One heating pad.  

The Fritzing diagram shows how the parts are connected.
