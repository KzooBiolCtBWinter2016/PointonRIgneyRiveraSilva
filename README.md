##Goals
  * Create Arduino code for a microcontroller
  * Use code for growing crickets
  * 
The script measures and controls temperature and humidity. The code requires an Arduino board connected to a computer and to two relays, one temperature and humidity sensor, one humidifier and a a heating pad to function properly. The connexions on the board can be found in the Fritzing diagram.
